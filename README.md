Welcome to the Large Language Model Workshop! ðŸš€

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a groundbreaking advancement in the field of natural language processing. These models are designed to comprehend and generate human-like text, exhibiting a remarkable ability to understand context, grammar, and even nuances in language. 

### Purpose of this Workshop

This workshop is designed to introduce participants to the fascinating world of LLMs and how to interact with them. Throughout this session, we'll explore how to:

- Prompt engineering with LLMs.
- Extract information and parse it in a structured way
- Build  Chatbots and ask questions over documents


## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone:** Clone this repository onto your local machine.
2. **Explore Notebooks:** Open and explore the Jupyter Notebooks provided in the repository. Follow along with the workshop instructions and code samples. You can open the notebooks via Google Collab.
3. **Launch applications:** If you want to launch the applications, create a new conda Environment based on `applications/environment.yml`. You can then launch the three applications (shortcuts provided in the `Makefile`).
